# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-ray Images
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Pneumonia is a severe respiratory infection that can lead to complications if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Automated pneumonia detection systems can assist healthcare professionals in quickly identifying pneumonia cases, leading to faster treatment and improved patient outcomes.
# Overview
The project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze chest X-ray images and classify them as either pneumonia-positive or pneumonia-negative. CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks as they can automatically learn relevant features from raw pixel data, making them particularly effective for medical image analysis tasks.
# Data-set
The dataset used in this project consists of chest X-ray images collected from various sources, including public repositories and healthcare institutions. The dataset is labeled with information indicating whether each image contains evidence of pneumonia or not. It is divided into training, validation, and test sets to train, evaluate, and validate the performance of the model.
# Future work
Future work on this project may involve improving the model's performance by exploring advanced neural network architectures, incorporating transfer learning techniques, and leveraging larger and more diverse datasets. Additionally, efforts may be made to enhance the interpretability of the model's predictions and ensure its robustness and reliability in real-world clinical settings.
